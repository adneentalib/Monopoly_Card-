# Monopoly_Card
This project creates a visually appealing Monopoly property card using HTML and CSS. 
The design features a flexible layout for the card's various sections, including the property title, rent information, and real estate options. The card is structured with distinct sections for the title deed, rental prices, and additional details like mortgage and hotel costs. CSS is used to style the card with a clean, structured layout, employing flexbox for alignment and spacing. 
The overall design ensures that the card's content is neatly presented and visually consistent.
